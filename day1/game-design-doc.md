# JS-Tank: Complete Game Design Document

## Game Concept
"JS-Tank" is a 3D multiplayer game where players control tanks on procedurally generated terrain. Players must eliminate other tanks while navigating the landscape strategically. The last tank standing wins the match.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5 Canvas and WebGL**: For rendering 3D graphics
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library to simplify WebGL implementation
- **Socket.io**: For real-time multiplayer communication

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests
- **Socket.io**: Server-side component for multiplayer functionality

## Grid-Based Terrain System

### Terrain Data Structure
- **Height Map Grid**: 2D array storing elevation values at regular intervals
- **Grid Resolution**: 1-2 meter spacing between grid points (configurable parameter)
- **Map Dimensions**: 256×256 or 512×512 grid cells, scaling with player count
- **Cell Properties**:
  - Base height value (elevation from sea level)
  - Surface type (soil, rock, water, etc.)
  - Obstacle presence flag
  - Destructible status
  - Traversability coefficient (affecting tank movement speed)

### Terrain Generation
- **Procedural Generation**: Server-side generation using seeded Perlin noise
- **Feature Generation**:
  - Strategic elevation patterns (hills, valleys, plateaus)
  - Water bodies as impassable areas
  - Resource points and strategic positions
  - Natural choke points to encourage tactical play
- **Cell Connectivity**: Algorithm ensures all areas of the map are reachable
- **Map Seeds**: Specific seeds can be saved for particularly good maps

### Server-Client Terrain Synchronization
- **Initial Load**: Client receives compressed height map on match start
- **Chunked Transmission**: Large maps divided into sectors for progressive loading
- **Delta Updates**: Only changed cells transmitted during gameplay (for destructible terrain)
- **LOD System**: Multiple resolution grids for different viewing distances

### Visual Representation
- **Mesh Construction**: Client constructs smooth terrain mesh from grid data
- **Texture Mapping**: Surface types determine visual appearance
- **Shading**: Dynamic lighting based on elevation and orientation
- **Decorative Elements**: Client-side procedural placement of visual-only elements (grass, rocks)

## Core Game Mechanics

### Tank Movement System
- **Physics Model**: Hybrid approach with continuous positions but grid-based validation
- **Movement Parameters**:
  - Maximum speed (affected by terrain type and slope)
  - Acceleration/deceleration rates
  - Turning speed/radius
  - Climbing ability (maximum traversable slope)
- **Control Scheme**:
  - WASD keys for forward, backward, strafe left/right
  - Mouse for turret/camera control
  - Shift for boost/speed mode (limited fuel)
- **Collision Detection**: Grid-aligned for major obstacles, with smooth boundaries

### Combat System
- **Weapon Mechanics**:
  - Projectile trajectory based on physics simulation
  - Shell types: Standard, Armor-Piercing, High-Explosive
  - Ballistics model accounting for gravity and velocity
- **Damage Model**:
  - Based on projectile type, impact angle, and armor values
  - Critical hit system for targeting weak points
  - Directional armor (front stronger than sides/rear)
- **Tank Stats**:
  - Health: 100 base hit points
  - Armor: Damage reduction percentage
  - Firepower: Damage output per shot
  - Reload Time: 3-5 seconds (varies by tank type)
  - Mobility: Maximum speed and turning rate

### Game Flow
1. **Lobby Phase**:
   - Players join and select tank types
   - Countdown starts when minimum player count reached
   - Map seed selection (random or predefined)

2. **Deployment Phase**:
   - 60-second preparation with terrain preview
   - Spawn point selection on map perimeter
   - Initial loadout confirmation

3. **Battle Phase**:
   - Free-for-all combat until one player remains
   - Gradual map restriction ("closing circle" mechanic)
   - Match duration target: 10-15 minutes

4. **Victory Phase**:
   - Winner announcement and stats display
   - Experience and reward distribution
   - Return to lobby for next match

## Multiplayer Implementation

### Network Architecture
- **Authoritative Server Model**: Server maintains source of truth
- **State Management**:
  - Server maintains grid state and all entity positions
  - Clients send input commands to server
  - Server validates, updates state, and broadcasts results
- **Update Frequency**:
  - Server tick rate: 20 updates per second
  - Position updates prioritized by proximity and visibility
- **Latency Compensation**:
  - Client-side prediction for movement
  - Server reconciliation for corrections
  - Interpolation between received positions

### Synchronization Protocol
- **Data Optimization**:
  - Position compression (fixed-point instead of floating-point)
  - Delta encoding for grid updates
  - Event-based messaging for non-continuous actions
- **Bandwidth Management**:
  - Relevance filtering based on distance
  - Update frequency scaling with player count
  - LOD for terrain and entity details

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- **Server Authority**: All critical calculations server-side
- **Movement Validation**: Positions checked against terrain grid
- **Shot Validation**: Server verifies line-of-sight and trajectory
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis of player behavior

## Player Progression

## Technical Implementation Details

### Terrain Grid Implementation
```javascript
// Server-side terrain grid structure
class TerrainGrid {
  constructor(width, height, seed) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.seed = seed;
    this.heightMap = new Float32Array(width * height);
    this.surfaceTypes = new Uint8Array(width * height);
    this.obstacles = new Uint8Array(width * height);
    
    this.generateTerrain();
  }
  
  generateTerrain() {
    // Initialize noise generator with seed
    const noise = new PerlinNoise(this.seed);
    
    // Generate height values
    for (let y = 0; y < this.height; y++) {
      for (let x = 0; x < this.width; x++) {
        const index = y * this.width + x;
        
        // Multi-octave noise for natural-looking terrain
        let elevation = 0;
        elevation += noise.noise2D(x * 0.01, y * 0.01) * 100; // Base hills
        elevation += noise.noise2D(x * 0.05, y * 0.05) * 20;  // Medium details
        elevation += noise.noise2D(x * 0.2, y * 0.2) * 5;     // Small details
        
        this.heightMap[index] = elevation;
        
        // Determine surface type based on elevation and additional noise
        this.determineSurfaceType(x, y, elevation);
        
        // Place obstacles based on separate noise function
        this.placeObstacles(x, y);
      }
    }
    
    // Ensure map connectivity (all areas accessible)
    this.ensureConnectivity();
  }
  
  // Additional methods for terrain management...
}
```

### Network Synchronization Example
```javascript
// Server-side position update logic
function broadcastPositionUpdates() {
  const updates = [];
  
  // For each player, prepare position data
  for (const player of activePlayers) {
    // Check if position is valid against terrain
    validatePosition(player);
    
    // Create compressed position update
    updates.push({
      id: player.id,
      x: Math.round(player.x * 100) / 100, // 2 decimal precision
      y: Math.round(player.y * 100) / 100,
      z: Math.round(player.z * 100) / 100,
      r: Math.round(player.rotation * 100) / 100,
      tr: Math.round(player.turretRotation * 100) / 100
    });
  }
  
  // Send batched updates to all players
  io.emit('position_update', updates);
}

// Run update loop at 20Hz
setInterval(broadcastPositionUpdates, 50);
```
